# Train-Tracker
Tracking next leaving Orange Line train using available API, and outputting the results to an LED matrix connected to my Raspberry Pi 



Samplebase and Graphics comes from the rpi-rbg-led-matrix repo. I only added the files necessary to run this program. You may find the original project here https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix.git
